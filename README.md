# atms-bank

Elixir GenServer atm-bank process practice.

Note: I've used Bancomer, Santander and HSBC as Bank names to gave it a sense of reality, Im not affiliated in any means with any of these banks.

Through the use of GenServer I've made a practice repo to establish communication between an ATM and a central Bank. In this case you can start any amount of Atms belonging to a bank, the bank centralizes the account numbers in a map that with a key belongs to a 16 digit card.
